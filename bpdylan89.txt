<p style="padding-top: 30px;"> BPDYLAN89 has been the on-line alias for Benjamin Dylan Prescott, me, over the past decade. 
A web development enthusiast and mobile fanatic, I have always been captivated by technology.
<br />
<br />While attending high school at Pembroke Academy I took introduction to programming, where I found my interest in computers. 
In class we were taught the fundamentals of programing, working with Qbasic and Visual Basic. Outside of school I spent time using various 
integrated development environments, Photoshop applications, and digital audio workstations to create an array of digital arts. 
Over the years learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through practice on social media sites like Myspace and tumblr. 
<br />
<br />Years later I began the endeavor experimenting with websites via managed hosting services and dedicated home server.
While also gaining a better understanding of web-mail, certificates, and a long list of server related software.
Using databases to store information and server-side scripting, to make an interactive portal website. 
Implementing the knowledge I have gained to create a growing number of web applications including a user database, cloud storage, and forum. <br />
<br />
The result is this website showcasing some of these skills. Check out the <a href="/projects.php" title="projects">code</a> that makes up this website here.
</p>
<p>I have also been experimenting with Java to learn the basics of creating an Android app. Using the Android and Java Development Kits 
to create templates in integrated environments like netbeans and eclypse I am able to create, edit, and compile code. Then, either through 
the virtual machine or debug bridge, I am can test apps on different builds of android. Through the creation of a simple Ouija Board I was able 
to learn about the life-cycle and processes of a Java based app. <br />
<br />
Take a look at the the project files and download the <a href="/projects.php#app_open" title="app">app</a> here.<br />
<br />
Eventually I would like to learn more about macOS & iOS, and begin working with Python and Ruby.. among others.
